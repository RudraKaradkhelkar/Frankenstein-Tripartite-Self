    <div class="event left" style="top: 10%;" data-popup='When Victor Frankenstein creates the creature, it is a manifestation of primal urges, desires, and instincts. The creature, upon his birth is an embodiment of the Id — an untamed force driven by pure instinct, seeking only survival. It represents the unconscious, impulsive, and hedonistic part of the psyche. The creature, devoid of societal influence or moral constraints, is ruled entirely by basic needs and desires for food, safety, and acceptance. This event sets the stage for the creature’s internal conflict and his struggle with the desires that come with his monstrous form.' >

His interaction with his environment is driven purely by biological necessity, symbolizing the raw, unbridled desires of the Id. The creature's initial acts of violence, such as his reaction to humans' fear of him, highlight his lack of control or consideration for consequences — key characteristics of the Id's influence.">

When he feels wronged by Victor’s rejection and the cruelty of society, his vengeance becomes an all-consuming urge, motivated by primal emotions like anger and hatred. The creature\'s desire for revenge is impulsive, based on an emotional need to balance perceived wrongs, showcasing how the Id governs his actions without concern for morality or long-term consequences.">

    <h2>Ego Timeline</h2>
    <div class="event left" style="top: 10%;" data-popup="Victor’s decision to create life is an embodiment of the Ego — the rational part of the mind that strives to fulfill desires in realistic ways. Initially, Victor is driven by the Ego\'s desire for success and recognition in the scientific community. His actions are based on reason and a calculated understanding of how to achieve greatness, yet he fails to anticipate the consequences of his creation. His mistake demonstrates the Ego\'s attempt to navigate the balance between inner desires and external limitations, only to be overwhelmed by the power of the Id (represented by the creature\'s instincts).">

The rational decision to reject the creature, born from fear and disgust, is the Ego attempting to control the Id’s chaotic energy.

This event underscores the tension between the conscious mind (Ego) and the primal forces within (Id).">

His rational mind cannot escape the consequences of the creature’s rage, reflecting the failure of the Ego to mediate the more destructive aspects of his desires.">

    <h2>Superego Timeline</h2>
    <div class="event left" style="top: 5%;" data-popup="In the beginning of the novel, Walton is driven by ambition to be great, which parallels that of Victor Frankenstein. He is determined to make scientific and geographical strides by reaching the North Pole. Through letters to his sister, the reader learns how adamant and resilient he is, stating that “I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and the secrets of the magnet… it is an enterprise which requires courage and perseverance.” (Shelley, Walton’s Letter 1). At this point in time, Walton embodies the psychological concept of the ego. While he is driven by ambition, he still has a sense of a moral compass as he reflects on the implications of his venture. The concept of the superego is present in his understanding that he is risking the safety of himself and his crew but it has not yet fully developed in his ability to assess the morality of his actions.">

    <div class="event right" style="top: 35%;" data-popup="When Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein on his voyage and begins to listen to his tragic past, he begins to question his own ambitions. Victor serves as a cautionary tale and he teaches Walton about the dangers of unchecked ambition. Victor wants to warn him not to fall down the same path as him, that he should “learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge.” (Shelley, Chapter 4). This is a turning point as Walton begins to reflect on the possible consequences of his ambition. While he still is determined to reach the North Pole, this part of the novel foreshadows the beginning of Walton’s moral development and how the superego is beginning to take hold and allow him to understand what may happen if he continues his voyage.">

As he ventures further into the Arctic, he is confronted with the worsening health and morale of his crew. In contrast to Victor Frankenstein, who ignored the welfare of his family to be able to pursue his scientific ambitions, Walton demonstrated empathy for his crew. He decides to turn back from his expedition because he saw how the journey is affecting his crew, even though he was so close to his goal of reaching the North Pole. He understood Victor’s tale and this is the moment where Walton’s superego guides him to prioritize the well-being of others over his own glory. After the death of Victor and the Creature’s disappearance, Walton experiences profound personal growth. He reflected on the importance of self-control and the destructive potential of unchecked ambition. By choosing to return home, he resolves to live a life more aligned with the superego.">
