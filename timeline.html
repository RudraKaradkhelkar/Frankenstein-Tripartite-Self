He represents the impulsive part of the psyche. The creature’s initial actions, devoid of societal influence or moral constraints, are ruled entirely by basic needs and desires for food, safety, and acceptance. This event sets the stage for the creature’s internal conflict and his struggle with the desires that come with his monstrous form.' >

    <div class="event right" style="top: 30%;" data-popup="At this point, the creature's instincts for survival come into full play. He searches for food, shelter, and security. His interaction with his environment is driven purely by biological necessity, symbolizing the raw, unbridled desires of the Id. It is clear that the creature doesn’t understand the world yet when he laments, “I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.” (Shelley, Chapter 11). The creature's initial acts of violence, such as his reaction to humans' fear of him, highlight his lack of control or consideration for consequences — key characteristics of the Id's influence.">

    <div class="event left" style="top: 50%;" data-popup="The creature’s decision to seek revenge on Victor represents the Id’s desires for retaliation and emotional gratification. When he feels wronged by Victor’s rejection and the cruelty of society, his vengeance becomes an all-consuming urge, motivated by primal emotions like anger and hatred. He feels hatred and frustration towards the DeLacey family for not accepting him either as well as the rejection by the girl that he saved in the stream. After all this, the creature says, “My daily vows rose for revenge - a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguishes I had endured.” (Shelley, Chapter 16). The creature's desire for revenge is impulsive, based on an emotional need to balance perceived wrongs, showcasing how the Id governs his actions without concern for morality or long-term consequences.">

    <div class="event right" style="top: 70%;" data-popup="The climactic confrontation between Victor and the creature illustrates the Id’s insistence on fulfilling desires, regardless of the consequences. The creature demands that Victor create a “Creature of another sex, but as hideous as [himself]...[so that they] shall be monsters…more attached to one another” (Shelley, Chapter 17) — an act driven by the Id's need for love, companionship, and acceptance. His persistence is rooted in a deep emotional drive, showing how the Id dominates his psyche at this moment, pushing for immediate satisfaction without regard for the moral implications of his request.">

Soon these burning miseries will be extinct.” (Shelley, Chapter 24). However, the sorrow he feels is rooted in the unfulfilled desires that have always governed his actions. The creature’s lamentation reveals the continuing dominance of the Id in his psyche — an unquenchable desire for acceptance, love, and meaning, which can never truly be satisfied. He realizes that he was always trying to seek acceptance from Victor (whether that be love or hatred), and now that he is dead, the creature doesn’t see any purpose that he has in life anymore.">

    <h2>Ego Timeline</h2>
    <div class="event left" style="top: 10%;" data-popup="Victor’s decision to create life is an embodiment of the Ego. Initially, Victor is driven by the Ego's desire for success and recognition in the scientific community. His actions are based on reason and a calculated understanding of how to achieve greatness, yet he fails to anticipate the consequences of his creation of life. His mistake demonstrates the Ego's attempt to navigate the balance between inner desires and external limitations, only to be overwhelmed by the power of the Id, which is represented by the creation’s instinctive nature.">

    <div class="event right" style="top: 35%;" data-popup="After the creature is brought to life, Victor’s refusal to take responsibility for his creation represents a failure of the Ego to reconcile his desires with moral responsibility. The rational decision to reject the creature, born from fear and disgust, is the Ego attempting to control the Id’s chaotic energy. However, Victor’s inability to act with compassion and accountability ultimately leads to disaster, and it causes tension between the two characters. This event underscores the tension between the conscious mind (Ego) and the primal forces within (Id).">

    <div class="event left" style="top: 60%;" data-popup="Victor’s pursuit of revenge against the creature exemplifies the Ego’s attempts to rationalize and direct emotions. Victor’s desire to kill the creature stems from a conscious need to rid himself of the torment the creature causes. The Ego attempts to find a sense of control and balance by focusing on the pursuit of revenge, but Victor’s obsession leads to self-destruction. His rational mind cannot escape the possible consequences of the creature’s rage, reflecting the failure of the Ego to mediate the more destructive aspects of his desires. The creature’s rage was brought upon Victor due to him destroying the female creature, which represents the ego trying to weigh the consequences of what creating a female creature could actually do. Due to his hatred of the creature and fear of what could happen, he decides that he would rather die than create another monster.">

Victor’s mind believes that the best option for him at that point is to pursue the creature to the death. Victor believes that the Creature is the main source of his misery (which is half true because although the Creature did kill Victor’s family, Victor is in part to blame due to his ignorance of his duties as a creator), and the Ego decided that the most acceptable option was to kill the creature. Victor’s death signifies the collapse of the Ego’s ability to mediate between the desires of the Id and the constraints of the Superego.">

    <h2>Superego Timeline</h2>
    <div class="event left" style="top: 5%;" data-popup="At the beginning of the novel, Walton is driven by ambition to be great, which parallels that of Victor Frankenstein. He is determined to make scientific and geographical strides by reaching the North Pole. Through letters to his sister, the reader learns how adamant and resilient he is, stating that “I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and the secrets of the magnet… it is an enterprise which requires courage and perseverance.” (Shelley, Walton’s Letter 1). At this point in time, Walton embodies the psychological concept of the ego. While he is driven by ambition, he still has a sense of a moral compass as he reflects on the implications of his venture. The concept of the superego is present in his understanding that he is risking the safety of himself and his crew but it has not yet fully developed in his ability to assess the morality of his actions.">

    <div class="event right" style="top: 35%;" data-popup="When Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein on his voyage and begins to listen to his tragic past, he begins to question his own ambitions. Victor serves as a cautionary tale and he teaches Walton about the dangers of unchecked ambition. Victor wants to warn him not to fall down the same path as him, that he should “learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge.” (Shelley, Chapter 4). This is a turning point as Walton begins to reflect on the possible consequences of his ambition. While he still is determined to reach the North Pole, this part of the novel foreshadows the beginning of Walton’s moral development and how the superego is beginning to take hold and allow him to understand what may happen if he continues his voyage.">

As he ventures further into the Arctic, he is confronted with the worsening health and morale of his crew. In contrast to Victor Frankenstein, who ignored the welfare of his family to be able to pursue his scientific ambitions, Walton demonstrated empathy for his crew. He decides to turn back from his expedition because he sees how the journey is affecting his crew, even though he is so close to his goal of reaching the North Pole. He understood Victor’s tale and this is the moment where Walton’s superego guides him to prioritize the well-being of others over his own glory. After the death of Victor and the Creature’s disappearance, Walton experiences profound personal growth. He reflected on the importance of self-control and the destructive potential of unchecked ambition. By choosing to return home, he resolves to live a life more aligned with the superego.">
