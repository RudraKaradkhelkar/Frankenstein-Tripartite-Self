The creature, upon his birth is an embodiment of the Id — an untamed force driven by pure instinct, seeking only survival. It represents the unconscious, impulsive, and hedonistic part of the psyche. The creature, devoid of societal influence or moral constraints, is ruled entirely by basic needs and desires for food, safety, and acceptance. This event sets the stage for the creature’s internal conflict and his struggle with the desires that come with his monstrous form.' >

Initially, Victor is driven by the Ego\'s desire for success and recognition in the scientific community. His actions are based on reason and a calculated understanding of how to achieve greatness, yet he fails to anticipate the consequences of his creation.
