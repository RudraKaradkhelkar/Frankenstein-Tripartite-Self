                	In psychology, the id is the instinctually driven component of decision making. It’s all about fulfilling basic desires and emotions without really thinking about the consequences. In real life, this can usually be seen in children that simply do what they want to do, not thinking of the consequences or rules.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The id represents impulsive and instinctual behavior without regard for social consequences.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In "Frankenstein", the Creature represents this part of the mind through his instinctually-driven actions which lack any forethought. When the Creature is born, he is overcome with lots of different emotions, especially a desire for connection. To fulfill this desire, he stalks the DeLacey family, observing their actions and secretly helping them. This is something that is not socially acceptable nor a rational solution to his problem, but rather is an impulsive decision made to fulfill his wants. In this way, the creature represents the id by acting on impulse rather than rational thought or morals.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Berman’s essay states that “Victor’s rejection defines the Creature’s identity” (Berman 29), referring to Victor’s immediate abandonment of the creature. This leads to his desire to make Victor’s life hell, with almost all of the Creature’s decisions throughout the book rooted in his hatred for Victor and need for revenge. Berman’s assertion that the Creature’s identity is shaped by Victor’s rejection is supported by the fact that the creature spends most of his time trying to make Victor’s life miserable by killing the ones he loves.

            <p>
                The Creature only begins to realize the consequences of his actions when he speaks with Walton at the end of the book, when Walton tells him his behavior is like “throw[ing] a torch into a pile of buildings; and when they are consumed[, sitting] among the ruins and lament[ing] the fall” (Shelley 195). This conversation with Walton is when the Creature finally realizes that his actions have consequences, something that he was blissfully unaware of throughout the entire story. This furthers the idea that the Creature represents the id by cementing the fact that the Creature made most of his decisions without thinking about their consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the Creature’s decision making throughout the story is symbolic of Freud’s id.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Ego: Rational Thinking and Internal Conflict</h2>
            <img class="image-placeholder" src="https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/healthy-psyche-1024x695.jpg">
            <p>
                In psychology, the ego is the rational thinking component of decision making. It balances the id’s instinctual desires with the morals of the superego. For example, a person waiting on their food in a restaurant may be hungry, but would recognize that they cannot take others’ food because that would be socially unacceptable and rude. They would also realize that their own food is on the way, and they’d consider the consequences of those actions. 
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The ego's goal is to satisfy the id's demands in a socially acceptable manner.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein embodies the ego through his struggle to balance his inner desires with the limits of the real world. From the beginning, Victor’s drive to create life is motivated by his inner desire for power, stating that “A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me” (Shelly 39). This selfish desire is limited by his recognition of the fact that it’s not only socially unacceptable but also immoral. This internal conflict represents the ego in having to balance Victor’s id and superego. However, his ambition ultimately ends up clouding his judgment and he succumbs to his instincts, failing to consider the moral responsibilities that come with creating life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Berman highlights this self-centeredness through his title for Victor, the “Modern Narcissus” (5). This title highlights the narcissistic traits that Victor exhibits throughout the story. He disregards the consequences that may come with creating life just so that he can do what he wants. His ego is narcissistic, prioritizing the id and his own desires rather than the superego’s moral component.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Superego: Moral Conscience and Responsibility</h2>
            <img class="image-placeholder" src="https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/neurotic-superego.jpg">
            <p>
                	In psychology, the superego is the moral conscience component of decision making.  It is the part of the mind that works out situations with critical thinking skills like the Ego, but instead prioritizes the wellbeing of others and maintains control over the instincts of self preservation.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The superego exists to limit and check the id's desires.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The character in Frankenstein that best represents someone that thinks with superego would be Walton.  Since the superego and ego are quite similar in the way they think, Walton and Victor have many similarities.  Walton is the first character introduced in Frankenstein who we learn about through his letters to his sister about his drive for conquering the arctic seas as a captain of a ship.  Walton  and his brief introduction shows us that he has a very strong ambition for conquering the arctic oceans as a captain, similar to how Victor has the ambition to create life.  
            </p>
            <p>
                However, where Walton diverges from Victor’s thinking is in how he values human life and is concerned for the safety of the people under his command. Walton’s journey, although brief, is crucial in showing the flaws of Victor’s ego.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bernan speaks heavily on the reasons why Victor’s ego makes him a very conflicting character that makes it a struggle to determine the real villain between the creature and its creator.  The bulk of Walton’s story being at the end of the book plays a very important role in showing the superego’s importance in thinking.  Walton’s story is one that can only become important because of the terrors of ambition and narcissism  that Victor’s story reveals.  The striking difference in how Walton tackles his goals where he drives to, “ Benefit humanity and, at the same time, achieve an eminence that will separate him from the human community”  (Bernan 40).  Walton is a person who faces the same world that Victor did but is able to learn from what Victor experienced and knows the weight of his actions.  For Walton to listen, word for word, Victor’s story and be able to leave knowing the consequences of Victor’s ambitions (which Victor himself did not realize) is the reason that Walton surpasses the self driven instinct of the ego and embodies the moralistic superego.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way, Bernan accurately determines why Walton holds the moral high ground over Victor and embodies superego by avoiding the mistakes of Victor and his destructive instincts.  Bernan’s interpretation of Walton’s superego shows that Walton is a critical factor in developing the theme that Mary Shelly develops in Frankenstein  that people should have self control over their ambitions and not act on the temptations that they face when presented with unknown opportunities and situations.  Victor’s ego drives him to create the destructive creature and Walton’s critical thinking allows him to learn from Victor’s mistake, show the ways that refraining from the temptations of ambition will lead to a more peaceful life and allow one to preserve their relationships with their friends and family which was something not learned from Victor.  
            </p>
            <p>
              	Walton provides a starking contrast from Victor and is the perfect character in Frankenstein to embody superego.  Walton’s ability to use his critical thinking skills but still value the lives of others details on the flaws of Victor’s self centered thinking and inability to refrain from putting all his values in his own ambitions and no one else’s is the reason he embodies superego.
